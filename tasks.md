# Project Brain Assist

**Overall Goal:**
Research how to build a state-of-the-art [agent type] (e.g., chatbot, personal assistant) that can autonomously perform tasks for the user while they are asleep, prioritizing high-quality results over efficiency or speed.

## Key Considerations:

* Identify potential use cases and applications for such an agent.
* Investigate existing solutions and their limitations.
* Explore the required technologies and frameworks (e.g., AI, machine learning, natural language processing) to develop a robust and reliable agent.

## Technical Requirements:

* Develop a [programming language] (e.g., Python, Java) framework for building and integrating the agent's functionality.
* Integrate with popular productivity tools and services (e.g., Google Calendar, Todoist) to streamline task management.
* Implement advanced natural language processing capabilities for effective communication and user interaction.

## Research Questions:

* What are the most critical factors in developing an agent that can perform tasks effectively while the user is asleep?
* How can we balance the trade-off between quality and speed in agent performance?
* Are there any existing solutions or technologies that can be leveraged to accelerate development?

## Potential Roadblocks and Mitigation Strategies:

* **Complexity of task automation**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components.
* **User acceptance and trust**: Implement clear user interfaces, provide transparency about agent capabilities, and establish a feedback mechanism.

By addressing these considerations, requirements, research questions, and potential roadblocks, we can create a comprehensive plan for building a state-of-the-art agent that meets the project's overall goal.
