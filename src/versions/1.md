# Understand
The provided code defines a function `improveCode` that leverages an external service, presumably "ollama," to improve code based on a given goal and current code. It constructs a system prompt and a user prompt, which includes the goal and current code, and sends them to ollama to generate an improved version of the code. The function returns the response from ollama, which represents the improved code.  The prompt is hardcoded, which limits it's flexibility.

# Critisize
The current code relies on a hardcoded system prompt. While this prompt is well-defined, it's inflexible. If the requirements for code improvement change, or if we want to experiment with different improvement strategies, we need to modify the prompt directly within the code. This can be cumbersome and error-prone. It would be better to pass the system prompt as an argument to the function.

# Plan
1.  Add a `system_prompt` parameter to the `improveCode` function.
2.  Use the provided `system_prompt` argument instead of the hardcoded `IMPROVE_CODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in the chat function call.
3.  Keep the existing logic for constructing the user prompt.
4.  Ensure that if no `system_prompt` is provided, the default prompt is used.

# Code
```js
import { chat } from "../olllama";

const IMPROVE_CODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are an expert in agentic AI system design.
You will be given a prompt and current code.
You will write a new improved code.

Guidelines:
1. Think step by step.
2. Write the code in a code block.
3. Follow the given format

Format:

<explain how the current code as it relates to the users goal>

# Critisize
<Think of one way the code could better achive it's goal. Think step by step>

# Plan
<Think of a plan for implementing that change. Think step by step>

# Code
